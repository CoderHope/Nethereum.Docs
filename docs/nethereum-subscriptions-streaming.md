# Subscriptions and Streaming 

Nethereum has support for both subscriptions (aka pub-sub) and streaming using Reactive extensions (observables).  They are mechanisms to receive changes occuring on the Blockchain which do not require you to write any polling code.

## Subscriptions
Geth and Parity subscriptions are supported. 

### **Geth** (from Geth docs):
> From version 1.4 geth has **experimental** support for pub/sub using subscriptions as defined in the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification. This allows clients to wait for events instead of polling for them.

Geth "pub-sub" Documentation
https://geth.ethereum.org/developers/RPC-PUB-SUB

Geth currently supports these subscriptions: "newHeads", "logs", "newPendingTransactions" and "syncing".

### **Parity**  (from Parity docs):
> Starts a subscription (on WebSockets / IPC / TCP transports) to results of calling some other RPC method. For every change in returned value of that RPC call a JSON-RPC notification with result and subscription ID will be sent to a client.

Parity "pubsub" docs:
https://wiki.parity.io/JSONRPC-parity_pubsub-module.html

## Subscription Considerations

From the Geth documentation - but most of it applies to Parity as well:

   > 1. notifications are send for current events and not for past events. If your use case requires you not to miss any notifications than subscriptions are probably not the best option.
   > 2. subscriptions require a full duplex connection. Geth offers such connections in the form of websockets (enable with â€“ws) and ipc (enabled by default).
   > 3. subscriptions are coupled to a connection. If the connection is closed all subscriptions that are created over this connection are removed.
   > 4. notifications are stored in an internal buffer and sent from this buffer to the client. If the client is unable to keep up and the number of buffered notifications reaches a limit (currently 10k) the connection is closed. Keep in mind that subscribing to some events can cause a flood of notifications, e.g. listening for all logs/blocks when the node starts to synchronize.

## Streaming Considerations

Much the same as subscription in practice.  

**Warning**
As of Nethereum v3.4.0 subscriptions and streaming are not compatible with Blazor.  This is because Blazor does yet not support Reactive and Websockets.

### Other Options:
Where subscriptions and streaming are not suitable, Nethereum provides these alternatives.
 * (Log Processing)[nethereum-log-processing-detail.md]
 * (Block Processing)[nethereum-block-processing-detail.md]
 * "Roll-Your-Own" (e.g. your own polling mechanism) using Nethereum to retrieve the data.

## Example
Below is a sample of streaming and subscriptions.  The same sample is available in the repo: https://github.com/Nethereum/Nethereum/blob/master/src/Nethereum.WebSocketsStreamingTest/Program.cs
