## What does mining Ethereum mean?

####tl;dr
Mining Ethereum means submitting a new block to a blockchain in the hope consensus is reached in favor of the block you submitted.

####Detailed explanation

####Why do blockchains need "_Proof of_"?
You probably noticed that most blockchains rely on either _**PoW (Proof of Work), PoS (Proof of Stake), PoA (Proof of Authority)**_ and various others.
The goal of the "proofing" work is to make it costly and difficult to add false transactions/spam to a block.

Proofing processes make it hard to add a block to the blockchain but easy to tell if the added block is valid.

####What is a Miner?
Miners are entities submitting new blocks to a blockchain.
