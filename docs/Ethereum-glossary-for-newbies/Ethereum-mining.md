## What is consensus in the Ethereum blockchain?

####tl;dr
The purpose of a consensus algorithm in a public Blockchain network is to make sure that the networkâ€™s participants agree on the current state of the Blockchain without the need to trust each other or to have a central authority.

####Detailed explanation

####Why do blockchains need "_Proof of_"?
You probably noticed that most blockchains rely on either _**PoW (Proof of Work), PoS (Proof of Stake), PoA (Proof of Authority)**_ and various others.
The goal of the "proofing" work is to make it costly and difficult to add false transactions/spam to a block.

Proofing processes make it hard to add a block to the blockchain but easy to tell if the added block is valid.

####Proof of Work
A _**proof of work**_ is a piece of data which is difficult (costly, time-consuming) to produce and satisfies certain requirements. Producing a proof of work can be a random process with low probability so that a lot of trial and error is required before a valid proof of work is generated. Ethereum currently uses proof of work (as of 07/25/2017) but is slated to adopt PoS soon.

####Proof of Stake
_**Proof-of-Stake**_ .

####Proof of Authority
_**Proof-of-authority**_ chains utilise a number of secret keys (authorities) to collaborate and create the longest chain instead of the public Ethereum network's proof-of-work scheme (Ethash).
