## What is an Ethereum Dapp?

####tl;dr
A **Dapp** is a decentralized app: a frontend that interacts with smart contracts.

In the case of Ethereum, a DApp has its backend code running on the Ethereum network. Contrast this with an app where the backend code is running on centralized servers.

A DApp can have frontend code and user interfaces written in any language (just like an app) that can make calls to its backend. Furthermore, its frontend can be hosted on decentralized storage such as Swarm or IPFS.

If an app=frontend+server, since Ethereum contracts are code that runs on the global Ethereum decentralized peer-to-peer network, then:

DApp = frontend + contracts
