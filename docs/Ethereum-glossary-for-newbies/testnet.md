## What is a testnet?

####tl;dr
Testnets simulate the Ethereum network and [EVM](/docs/Ethereum-glossary-for-newbies/EVM.md). They allow developers to upload and interact with smart contracts without paying the cost of gas.

####Detailed explanation

####Why use a Testnet?
As a developer, Testnets have several benefits:
#####1. Testnets are free to use
Smart contracts must pay gas for their computations on the Ethereum network. If you rent the Ethereum network to run a contract, you have to pay. However, testnets provide free or unlimited gas. That allows developers to test contracts without having to pay real money for their execution.
#####2. Testnets are fast
The Ethereum main net takes about 20 seconds to process transactions while testnets are nearly instantaneous.
#####3. Testnets provide more feedback
Calls to lightweight testnet nodes provide good error messages.
