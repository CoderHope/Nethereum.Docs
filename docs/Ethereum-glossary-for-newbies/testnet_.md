## What is a testnet?
  
  
#### tl;dr
  
Testnets simulate the Ethereum network and [EVM](EVM.md ). They allow developers to upload and interact with smart contracts without paying the cost of gas.
  
### Detailed explanation
  
  
### Why use a Testnet?
  
As a developer, Testnets have several benefits:
#### 1. Testnets are free to use
  
Smart contracts must pay gas for their computations on the Ethereum network. If you rent the Ethereum network to run a contract, you have to pay. However, testnets provide free or unlimited gas. That allows developers to test contracts without having to pay real money for their execution.
#### 2. Testnets are fast
  
The Ethereum main net takes about 20 seconds to process transactions while testnets are nearly instantaneous.
#### 3. Testnets provide more feedback
  
Calls to lightweight testnets nodes provide good error messages.
  
### What Testnets can I use?
  
  
  
##### 1. Test RPC
  
Although not a "true Testnet" since it runs locally, Test RPC is ideal to start a project, execute [transactions](transaction.md ) instant response
