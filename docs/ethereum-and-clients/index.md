#Ethereum Clients

To integrate with Ethereum, Nethereum requires a Ethereum client node like Geth, parity, Quorum etc with RPC / IPC enabled.

The client might be installed locally, a server you control or be a public node depending on your needs and use case. For smart contract development you can also install Test RPC, which provides a very fast Ethereum simulator, providing a great feedback cycle.

For example, if you are just interested to retrieve existing data from contracts, or sending offline signed transations from the Ethereum public chain, you can just use a public node like Infura without the need to install locally a node client like Parity or Geth.
