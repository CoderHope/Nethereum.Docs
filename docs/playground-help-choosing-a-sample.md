| I want to...             | ...and...                                  | Link to Playground Sample or Help        |

| **Deploy a contract**        | and I have the bytecode ready              | [Playground: Smart Contracts: Smart contract deployment](http://playground.nethereum.com/csharp/id/1006). |
|                          | and I don't know what the word "bytecode" means | Ethereum bytecode is an assembly language made up of multiple instructions called opcodes. Each opcode [performs a certain action](https://medium.com/mycrypto/the-ethereum-virtual-machine-how-does-it-work-9abac2b7c9e) on the Ethereum blockchain. Bytecode is produced when the contract is compiled. |
|                          | and I know what bytecode means but I don't have the bytecode for this contract | This solution requires that you have the Solidity source code for the contract. Use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) with the [Solidity plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JuanBlanco.solidity) to compile your contract (F1 -> Solidity Compile). The compilation process produces a `\bin\contractName.bin` file containing a long string. That string is your bytecode, just prefix it with `0x` and paste it into [this playground sample](http://playground.nethereum.com/csharp/id/1006).  |
| **Interact with a contract** | and I have the ABI for this contract and I'm happy to have some code generated for me to make interaction easier       | One way to interact with your contract like this is use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) with the [Solidity plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JuanBlanco.solidity) to generate some C# classes to help you. See [the Nethereum documentation](https://docs.nethereum.com/en/latest/nethereum-codegen-vscodesolidity/) about how to generate these C# classes from VSCode. There are also [other ways to generate the same helper code](https://docs.nethereum.com/en/latest/nethereum-code-generation/). Once generated, look for the class ending with the name `Service` and examine the methods inside. This was of interacting with contracts can be referred to as the "typed" way. |
| | and I have the ABI for this contract and I don't want code generated to help me, I want complete control and visibility of everything going on |  See [the playground sample](http://playground.nethereum.com/csharp/id/1045) about interacting with contracts in an "untyped" manner. |
|	                       | and I don't know what the word "ABI" means	| See [StackOverflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/a/235). |
|                          | and I know what ABI means but I don't have the ABI for this contract | This solution requires that you have the Solidity source code for the contract. The ABI is produced during the Solidity contract compilation process. Follow the same steps as described above for one of the cases starting "and I have the ABI for this contract...". |
| **Retrieve event logs**	   | and I have a specific transaction receipt	| [Playground: Smart Contracts: Events (End to End Introduction)](http://playground.nethereum.com/csharp/id/1008). |
| **Retrieve historic event logs** | and I want to search by very specific event parameters and I know it will retrieve not much data (a few thousand events) | [Playground: Retrieving Events By Parameter Value (PR)](https://github.com/Nethereum/Nethereum.Playground/blob/419a791478c0c7d25671d06b4e50b2262aba94b8/Nethereum.Playground/wwwroot/samples/csharp/1049.txt). |
|	                       | and I want to retrieve a lot of data (more than a few thousand events) and I want batching handled for me _and/or_ I want robust retry/restart functionality built-in without me having to code it _and/or_ I want to perform some processing the moment I receive each event. | See playground samples starting with the name `Log Processing:` for example [Playground: Log Processing: any contract any log](http://playground.nethereum.com/csharp/id/1028). | 
| **Retrieve historic block, transaction and event log information**   |     | See playground samples starting with the name `Block Crawl Processing:` for example [Playground: Block Crawl Processing: Full sample](http://playground.nethereum.com/csharp/id/1025) |
| **Create an HD Wallet** | | See playground samples starting with the name `Accounts: HD Wallets` for example [Playground: Accounts: HD Wallets (Introduction)](http://playground.nethereum.com/csharp/id/1043) | 
| **Check an address is valid** | | [Playground: Utilities: Address Utilities](http://playground.nethereum.com/csharp/id/1039) |
